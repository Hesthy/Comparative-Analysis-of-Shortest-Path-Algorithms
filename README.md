# Comparative Analysis of Shortest Path Algorithms

This project implements and compares three classical shortest path algorithms: **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**, and **A* (A-Star) Search**.  
We conduct experimental evaluations using real-world transportation data (London Underground network) to analyze and compare their performance under different scenarios.
